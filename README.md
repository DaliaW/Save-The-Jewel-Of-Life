# Save-The-Jewel-Of-Life
To save the jewel of life, we need to make it first through a garden maze (env 1/ lvl 1) with a light yellow swaying light then through a hell chamber (env 2/ lvl 2) with a red swaying light. The goal of the garden maze is the house that will take you underground to the next level (i.e. hell chamber). Then, the goal in the hell chamber will be to make it out through a door before the chamber crushes you! The jewel of life will be waiting at the chamber end. We must save it before time is up (and to not get crushed)!  ( Obstacles which require the implementation of obstacle avoidance or collision detection algorithms. ) and (â€¢ The game must have two different scenes (two different levels). This means two different environments. )  +  (Light effect is required: This includes different types of light as well as light animations.)
