# Save-The-Jewel-Of-Life
To save the jewel of life, we need to make it first through a garden maze (env 1/ lvl 1) with a light yellow swaying light then through a hell chamber (env 2/ lvl 2) with a red swaying light. The goal of the garden maze (collide!) is the hole (collide!) that will take you underground to the next level (i.e. hell chamber). Then, the goal in the hell chamber will be to make it out through a door before the chamber crushes you (collide)! The jewel of life will be waiting at the chamber end (collide!). We must save it before time is up (and to not get crushed)!  ( Obstacles which require the implementation of obstacle avoidance or collision detection algorithms. ) and (• The game must have two different scenes (two different levels). This means two different environments. )  +  (Light effect is required: This includes different types of light as well as light animations.)


To play: use the keyboard arrows to let the player move left, right, forward, or backward (player animated). Left-click to allow the player to jump and collect coins (player and coin disappearance animations)! ( Navigation through the game using the keyboard and mouse functions.) and (Generation of animations with every user interaction. )

Env 1 target: the hole! (to proceed to next level)
Env 2 target: the jewel of life! (main target)

The score is calculated as follows:
Bronze coin = +1 to score
SIlver coin = +2 to score
Gold coin = +3 to score

(Since it is a game, a main target is needed along with the calculation of a final score. )


Using the ‘f’ key, you can see through the eyes of the player. Using the ‘t’ key, you can see a top view of the game!
(Camera navigation through the game can be controlled using the keyboard or the mouse functions or both. Camera motions must include first person and third person perspective cameras) 


Everything should be textured with exception for small objects => will do. :) 
Holes, flowers, coins, the jewel, and other ‘small’ objects in this sense will not be textured. If we import models made in Maya or other 3D engines, we assume that it is a textured object.
